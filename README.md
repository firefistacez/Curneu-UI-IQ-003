This is a website that I created as a beginner website by following a YouTube tutorial.

The given task was to "Build a conceptual 3D website using three.js". I am experienced in creating a website using ReactJS but not with three.js. I built this website by following an YouTube tutorial.
[YouTube video that helped me create this web page](https://youtu.be/Qs9A3XIjbg4)

The website contains various components as follows:
1. Adding a 3d image of an armchair.
2. Adding lighting to the chair so that it is visible - Using ambientLight, directionalLight and spotLight
3. Making sure that it is placed in the center of the page - Using position
4. Making the chair to rotate   automatically. - useRef

The main code is return in the App.js .
